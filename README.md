# TicTacToe
A Tic Tac Toe Game derived from 8th Light coding challenge

This is an unbeatable tic tac toe game that I presented as part of the coding challenge from 8th Light Apprenticeship application. The game has got several unit tests for different classes.

The game features three game options: Player vs computer, Player vs Player and Computer vs Computer. Players can select their own marker to play.

How to initiate: Run game.py from the Terminal by typing python game.py and follow ingame instructions.
